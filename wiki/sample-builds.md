Here you'll find some pre-builts/mini-pcs and some sample DIY PC builds for HT, Emulation, Media Server and NAS purposes in their relevant sections. Before going through this page, look at the common scenarios in the [I want a HTPC/media device recommendation, but don't want to get into the complicated details](/wiki/faq#i-want-a-htpcmedia-device-recommendation-but-dont-want-to-get-into-the-complicated-details) section of the FAQ. You may find your specific scenario there and a device to match before you go down this rabbit hole. If what you want is not there, then read on here.  

Keep in mind, these are meant as examples for certain usage scenarios, even though they are real builds. You can add/subtract/replace certain components (such as storage) to match your specific budget or requirements, but they should be a good starting point. If you're un-sure, post and ask us.  

You can use [PCPartPicker](http://www.pcpartpicker.com/) to help you select parts that will all fit and work together.

## HTPC Pre-builts/Mini-PCs

The SBC options below will have the highest power efficiency, but also lowest comparative performance. Intel N/NUC CPUs (e.g. N5105/N95) have high efficiency. Intel T CPUs (e.g. i3-7100T) medium efficiency. Intel non-T/AMD CPUs, low efficiency.  
Choosing the least expensive option is attractive, but not always the best course of action. Be mindful of the added costs like storage, adapters, shipping. Other factors can include limitations like operating system support, warranty, QC and reliability.  
Respected mfgrs are: intel, hp, dell, apple, lenovo, asus, asrock, simply nuc, zotac, shuttle.

### 1080p PLAYERS

**TL;DR If you're just playing H264-encoded video, a small ARM-based SBC is fine. If you want HEVC or VP9 (youtube) decoding, then a used Intel 7th gen USFF/SFF/NUC off ebay for $75-125 if you're on a tight budget. For new, an Intel N95 based mini pc <= $150 with ram/disk.**  

 $45-$55: SMALLEST (Linux/Coreelec/Libreelec only): SBC: [ROCK64-2GB](https://pine64.com/product/rock64-2gb-single-board-computer/) / [ROCK64-4GB](https://pine64.com/product/rock64-4gb-single-board-computer/) / [Orange Pi 3](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804341645667.html) / [Odroid XU4](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-xu4-special-price/). 32GB MicroSD. X86 Alternative: Atomic Pi x5-z8350 atom 2GB + Baby Breakout Board + PSU (Windows, Linux). Least powerful but small and cheap.  

 $60-100: SMALL/MEDIUM: Used HP/Dell/Lenovo - Intel - i3/i5-7100T/7400T/7500T, >= 8GB RAM, >= 120GB disk.

### 4K HDR PLAYERS

**TL;DR If you're on a budget, then an Intel N95/N100 based mini pc for $140-$170 with ram/disk is fine. If you can afford it, look at a Beelink SEI 11/12 for $300 for better future-proofing (AV1).**

## HTPC DIY builds

<!-- Sub-Section -->

### CHEAPEST 4K HTPC PLAYER - USED

TL;DR: Cheapest hardware for 4k@60Hz, HDR and/or 4k netflix player, or a dead simple media server.  

For the insanely frugal, the absolute cheapest way to buy/build a PC for use as a 4k@60Hz player - using used hardware off eBay.  

We will use a i5-4570 CPU and Nvidia GT 1030 GDDR5 GPU (not DDR4).

If you have more specific GPU usage needs, then..  
4K local+youtube: The quoted config  
4K local+netflix: [AMD RX 550 4GB](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=rx+550+%22hdmi%22&_sacat=27386&LH_TitleDesc=0&_fsrp=1&_odkw=rx+550+4GB+%22hdmi%22&_osacat=27386&LH_BIN=1&_sop=15&LH_PrefLoc=2&_udhi=120.00) ($50)  
4K local+netflix+youtube: [Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti 4GB](https://www.ebay.com/sch/27386/i.html?_fsrp=1&rt=nc&_from=R40&_nkw=gtx+1050+ti&LH_BIN=1&_sacat=27386&LH_TitleDesc=0&_sop=15&_udhi=120.00&LH_ItemCondition=1000%7C2500%7C3000%7C1500) ($70) + Mini Tower case or low-profile card for $20 more.  
1080p: no dGPU  

The quoted config here is with a SFF form factor case, for use with a low-profile GPU, but if you want one of the Mini Tower form factor versions shown as ALT: below , that's fine as well.  

If you don't even need 4k or are using it as a dead simple media server, drop the GPU and you have yourself a very capable all in one 1080p box for $50. Getting one with an included SSD for your OS drive will be very helpful for responsiveness on these low-end machines.

### 4K HDR PLAYER (2-3L)

TL;DR: You want a small 4K@60 HDR player and don't need any or only a small amount of storage.  

Tiny, simple 4K player. For local content, 4k netflix, youtube, browsing, light 1080p gaming.  

Not the cheapest hardware; just a nice setup. You have the option to bump up to a better 5600G/5700G CPU for $25-50 more. If you can't afford the optional CPU cooler, pop the top off the stock AMD one to make it fit.  

If you can't find the Deskmini case and still want to build, look at the Inwin Chopin alternate build. There's also a stack of good Tiny cases in the [Cases section](/wiki/faq#cases) of the Wiki FAQ. You should use [Pico PSU 150W+](https://www.mini-box.com/Power-Supplies-Kits)-style kits for these.  

You could add some media storage with a [2.5" HDD](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/internal-hard-drive/#xcx=0&f=3&sort=ppgb&A=1900000000000,20000000000000&page=1), but these cases are not for internal 3.5" HDD media storage - they're too small for that.  If you want to stay within this size case, either use external USB HDDs or buy/build a [NAS](/wiki/storage#pre-built-nas-list) for backend storage. Otherwise, look at the all-in-one builds below.

### 4K HDR ALL-IN-ONE PLAYER (8-9.6L)

TL;DR: You care about 4K@60 quality, 4K Netflix and HDR, may want HDD media storage and want a value build that doesn't break the bank.  

An AMD Ryzen APU is the best way to get 4k Netflix and HDR at the same time. Light 720p/1080p gaming can also be had on it. An Intel alternative is also provided in the part list if you want to future proof a little more with AV1 decoding, but plan to give up any light gaming vs the Ryzen.  

Expect HDR processing and upscaling with madVR to operate at a basic level - don't expect to be doing heavy upscaling here without a dGPU.  

You can add 3.5" HDD content storage for an all-in-one. Since optional, it's not included in the price.  

Choose the DeskMeet option if you don't have a height restriction (like a small media cabinet) or want a full-height ITX GPU, otherwise choose the Apex or one of the slimmer variations.  

*Larger Slimmer variation*: 12-16L, 4" (H): Change CASE to [InWin BL040](https://www.amazon.com/InWin-BL040-mATX-Desktop-Black/dp/B0964K2W4R)/[Apex DM-387](https://www.newegg.com/black-apex-dm-387-micro-atx-media-center-htpc-case/p/N82E16811154087) (PSU still included) ($75-100) or a Silverstone [ML03](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/bWR48d/silverstone-case-ml03b)/[ML04](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/fsw323/silverstone-case-ml04b) (3xHDD), (add an [ATX PSU](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/power-supply/#sort=price&e=4,3,2,1&th=1&m=8,337,50,11,14,106,101,18,229,51,71,63,441,113,56)). You can change to a [uATX mobo](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/motherboard/#xcx=0&f=7&c=145&sort=price&page=1) with these cases, which is cheaper than ITX. LP dGPU possible

*Larger Cube variation*: 12-16L: $50 more. Change CASE to [Silverstone SG13B](https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-Mini-ITX-Computer-SST-SG13B-USA/dp/B07MNC3JCB) (1xHDD) or [Sharkoon QB One](https://www.amazon.com/Sharkoon-ONE-ITX-CABINET-4044951016433/dp/B00TL8VN5I) (2xHDD), add an [ATX PSU](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/power-supply/#sort=price&e=4,3,2,1&p=1,2&th=1). ITX dGPU possible

**DeskMeet - Cube, 8.8L**

### CHEAPEST 4K HDR/ALL-IN-ONE PLAYER - NEW (14L)

TL;DR: You want 4K@60 local/youtube/netflix HDR on a real PC, may want HDD media storage and want the cheapest build with new hardware that we're comfortable recommending.  

Not the prettiest case, but slim and gets the job done at 14 liters.  

Light 720p gaming can be had here, if you need.  

You can add one or more 3.5" HDD content storage for an all-in-one.  

*Tiny variation*: 1.9L: $25 more. Change CASE & MOBO to a ASRock Deskmini X300W ($180) (mobo included), change MEM to [SO-DIMM](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/memory/#xcx=0&b=ddr4&ff=ddr4_sodimm&sort=price&Z=8192001,8192002)s. No 3.5" HDD content storage possible because of size, only [2.5" HDD](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/internal-hard-drive/#xcx=0&f=3&sort=ppgb&A=1900000000000,20000000000000&page=1).

### AV1 DECODING ALL-IN-ONE PLAYER (14L)

HTPC that can hardware decode the next-gen AV1 codec without buying a dGPU, which costs as much as this whole system. Also can do 4K local/youtube/netflix HDR as well as fit a couple 3.5" HDDs.

MicroATX is the cheapest, but ITX alternatives aren't much more.

*Tiny variation*: 1.9L: Change CASE & MOBO to a ASRock Deskmini B660W ($180) (mobo included), change MEM to [SO-DIMM](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/memory/#xcx=0&b=ddr4&ff=ddr4_sodimm&sort=price&S=2666,8000&Z=16384002)s.

### FANLESS 4K HDR PLAYER (4.6L)

Completely fanless solution for 4k HDR media playback and/or 720p/1080p gaming emulation.  

You could add some media storage with [2.5" HDD](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/internal-hard-drive/#xcx=0&f=3&sort=ppgb&A=1900000000000,20000000000000&page=1)s, but this is not for internal 3.5" HDD media storage - 
it's too small for that. Look at the [HD Plex H3 (11L)](https://hdplex.com/hdplex-h3-v3-fanless-computer-chassis.html) or [FC8 Alpha](https://www.quietpcusa.com/Streacom-HTPC-Cases/Streacom-FC8-ALPHA-HTPC-Chassis) chassis or the next super low power build instead.  
These cases are popular and low production, so don't be surprised if they're out of stock.  
A comparable, similarly priced alternative is the [Streacom FC8 Alpha](https://www.quietpcusa.com/Streacom-HTPC-Cases/Streacom-FC8-ALPHA-HTPC-Chassis). The [DB1](https://www.quietpcusa.com/streacom-htpc-cases/streacom-1-fanless-chassis) is also an option and much cheaper than the others, though will limit you to 45W ECO mode on the CPU.

### Super low power all-in-one fanless player (3.3L)

Low power, fanless CPU (6W), 4k@60Hz playback, 4k netflix/YT, HDR. Case specced can fit 1x3.5" HDD. This is for someone who wants a low power build with the flexibility to choose ram/ssd/HDD/PCIe vs a pre-built mini PC which does not afford that flexibility or expansion.  
Upgrade to alternative mATX version of the build for up to 3x3.5 HDDs, though more than 2x HDDs are not recommended due to heat concerns and you lose fanless operations due to the Inwin case's internal PSU. If you really want fanless, you can do some hardware gymnastics with a Silverstone ML03 case, a SATA power splitter, a PCIE->SATA board and either a [Streacom Nano120 PSU Kit](https://shop.streacom.com/collections/pc-power-supplies/products/nano120?variant=40723339378897) or [Rgeek DC->ATX PSU](https://www.amazon.com/RGEEK-Switch-24pin-Supply-Computer/dp/B071P3HMNK)+[130W AC-DC Adapter](https://www.mini-box.com/130W-AC-DC-Power-Adapter), though this would not be recommended.

### MadVR upscaling all-in-one player (14L)

This is a build with a low profile dGPU for MadVR upscaling that's going to provide better visual quality than the iGPU on a CPU. Other features include 4k@60 playback, 4k netflix/YT, HDR, and medium 1080p gaming.

The Nvidia GTX 1650 chosen is the most powerful low profile GPU you will find, with the AMD RX 6400 also capable and a little cheaper.  

We don't go beyond an entry-level GPU here for MadVR upscaling because we feel you start to get into diminishing returns on visual quality, while incurring more power usage and heat.  

If you want to do madVR tonemapping, change the GPU to a GTX 1660 and change the CASE to a Silverstone [GD-05 (21L)](https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/GD05/) and add a [500W+ ATX PSU](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/power-supply/#xcx=0&th=1&sort=price&m=8,337,50,11,14,17,18,27,28,94,29,229,51,71,63,441,56). If you want to keep a slimmer profile, change the CASE to a Silverstone [ML07 (14L)](https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/ML07/), the MOBO to an ITX one and add a [450W+ SFX PSU](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/power-supply/#xcx=0&th=5&sort=price&m=8,337,50,11,14,101,17,18,27,28,94,29,229,51,71,63,441,56&A=450000000000,2050000000000).  

If you can't afford to do a new build, you can buy a [2nd-hand SFF pre-built](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=sff+%28i5-7400%2Ci5-7500%2Ci5-7600%2Ci5-8400%2Ci5-8500%2Ci5-8600%29+-optiplex+-prodesk&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&_fsrp=1&_odkw=sff+%28i5-7400%2Ci5-7500%2Ci5-7600%29+-optiplex+-prodesk&_osacat=0&_sop=15) off ebay and pop the GTX 1650 low profile in it.

### UHD MakeMKV Ripping/Handbrake Transcoding Machine (12-20L)

A build for ripping DVD/FHD Blu Ray and UHD Blu Ray discs. As such, it has space for an internal 5.25 drive and 2-3 HDDs to make this into a NAS/
media server as well.  
If you don't need the drive space and want something smaller, consider the Silverstone ML03/ML04 (16L) w/the i5-13400 instead and no additional CPU Cooler; or the In Win CE685 (12L) w/i5-13400, no cooler or PSU.  
Alternatively, if you want MORE HDD space look at Silverstone's GD06 (4)/TJ08B-E (6)/GD07 (8)/GD08 (9).  

This uses a modern 10-core CPU w/IGPU for very fast Handbrake transcoding performance. This is a high watt part and necessitates an additional CPU cooler. If you don't need best-in-class performance, you can switch to something like a i5-13400 with the stock cooler. and B660 mobo  

Standard software for ripping is: [MakeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com) to rip a disc to a full quality file, and then [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr) to optionally transcode it down for size and client compatibility. Check the [ripping section](/wiki/faq#how-can-i-rip-my-dvdblu-ray-discs-and-what-are-some-good-quality-settings-to-use) of our FAQ page for detailed instructions. Check [this post](https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=16) on the makemkv forum for firmware for your drive.   
For automated ripping on disc insert, look at [Automatic Ripping Machine](https://github.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine) (ARM), which is a front-end to makemkv/handbrake. Its setup on Linux is not for the faint of heart. 
Alternatively, on Windows look at [Staxrip](https://github.com/staxrip/staxrip) or the old [Autorip](https://videoscripts.wordpress.com/2011/11/16/autorip-updated-3/).  

If you can't afford to spend this much, buy a 2nd-hand pre-built and make some upgrades. Look at the "Medium NAS / Media Server (9-26L)" build below; they come with DVD drives standard. You can then upgrade to FHD/UHD ripping with a [LG BU40N](https://www.ebay.com/itm/332968508515?epid=21020020503&hash=item4d86783c63:g:DpkAAOSwF7lcHJ6b) FHD/UHD blu-ray drive, a [Slimline SATA Adapter](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=slimline+sata+to+sata+adapter+-usb+-nvme+-mount&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&_odkw=slimline+sata+to+sata+adapter+-usb+-nvme&_osacat=0), and be out for $250.

## NAS/Media Server builds

There are many tiers of builds depending on what tasks you want to accomplish, how much internal capacity you need and your budget level. We'll provide a couple common builds here in increasing complexity. There is no one-size-fits-all and the options can be wide and varied.  

<!-- Sub-Section -->

### $100 Small Media Server (1.2L) - Used

This is a good setup to get your feet wet in media serving in a very small package. A used pre-built is cheaper and easier to get going if you're new to this. If you're not comfortable buying used, [this](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=beelink+s12&rh=p_36%3A-16000&s=price-asc-rank&crid=YOSERLYHUDQP&qid=1685387664&rnid=2421879011&sprefix=beelink+s1%2Caps%2C384&ref=sr_st_price-asc-rank&ds=v1%3AjCJk5ImalsHH5bGp%2ByrAujUqrngfu7XTIu0GkcXwbqQ) is comparable.  

Most people will use it with Plex Media Server to serve media up to clients, but you can serve media up to Kodi clients over a network/samba share just as well.  

If you're using it with Plex, it will [Direct Play](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200430303-streaming-overview/) content to multiple clients just fine (even 4k). If you need to transcode content either internally or remotely, it 
will [transcode](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200430303-streaming-overview/) 2x 1080p streams or 4x 720p streams using software/cpu transcoding in the free version of Plex Media Server.  

If you need to transcode more streams than this (either because your internal clients don't support your media's codecs and/or because you have a lot of remote users), pay for a [Plex Pass](https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/) (or use Jellyfin) and it will then [hw transcode](https://support.plex.tv/articles/115002178853-using-hardware-accelerated-streaming/) more 1080p and 4k streams.  

It's preferred to use an SSD for your OS drive and for storing Plex Metadata. Purchase one separately as per the parts list below or get one included.

With a form factor this small you should use USB external drives, like a [WD Elements/Easystore](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/wd-easystore-8tb-external-usb-3-0-hard-drive-black/6425302.p?skuId=6425302&utm_source=feed) for media storage. It is possible to use an internal [2.5" HDD](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/internal-hard-drive/#xcx=0&A=900000000000,22000000000000&sort=price&f=3&t=5000,5200,5400,5640,5700,5760,5900,5940,7200&page=1) up to 5TB if you use an M.2 SSD for your OS. If you want an internal 3.5" HDD instead, look at the next build.  

See our [Storage Setup Guide](/wiki/storage) for more information on software, drives and pre-built NASes.  

Will handle 1080p video front-end duties fine.

### $125 Medium NAS / Media Server (9-26L) - Used

This is also a good setup to get your feet wet. A used pre-built is cheaper and easier to get going if you're new to this. A NAS/media server with these specs has the potential to handle anything you can throw at it with the ability to have some internal media storage. If you're not comfortable buying used, [these](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_fsrp=1&_from=R40&LH_TitleDesc=1&LH_PrefLoc=2&LH_ItemCondition=1000&Form%2520Factor=Mini%2520Tower%7CSmall%2520Form%2520Factor%2520%2528SFF%2529%7CTower%7CMini%2520Pc&_nkw=%28hp%2Cdell%29+%28i3%2Ci5%2Ci7%29&_sacat=179&LH_BIN=1&_sop=15&rt=nc&Processor=Intel%2520Core%2520i7%252012th%2520Gen%252E%7CIntel%2520Core%2520i5%252013th%2520Gen%252E%7CIntel%2520Core%2520i5%252011th%2520Gen%252E%7CIntel%2520Core%2520i3%252012th%2520Gen%252E%7CIntel%2520Core%2520i5%25209th%2520Gen%252E%7CIntel%2520Core%2520i7%25209th%2520Gen%252E%7CIntel%2520Core%2520i3%252011th%2520Gen%252E%7CIntel%2520Core%2520i7%252010th%2520Gen%252E%7CIntel%2520Core%2520i5%252012th%2520Gen%252E%7CIntel%2520Core%2520i3%25209th%2520Gen%252E%7CIntel%2520Core%2520i3%252010th%2520Gen%252E%7CIntel%2520Core%2520i5%252010th%2520Gen%252E%7CIntel%2520Core%2520i7%252013th%2520Gen%252E%7CIntel%2520Core%2520i7%252011th%2520Gen%252E&_oaa=1&_dcat=179) are comparable.  

Most people will use it with Plex Media Server to serve media up to clients, but you can serve media up to Kodi clients over a network/samba share just as well.  

If you're using it with Plex, it will [Direct Play](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200430303-streaming-overview/) content to multiple clients just fine. If you need to transcode content either internally or remotely, it 
will [transcode](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200430303-streaming-overview/) 2x 1080p streams or 5x 720p streams using software/cpu transcoding in the free version of Plex Media Server.  

If you need to transcode more streams than this (either because your internal clients don't support your media's codecs and/or because you have a lot of remote users), pay for a Plex Pass (or use Jellyfin) and it will then [hw transcode](https://support.plex.tv/articles/115002178853-using-hardware-accelerated-streaming/) 6x 4k streams or 20x 1080p streams using the iGPU.  

Internally this server will support 1x M.2 NVME SSD drive, 1x 2.5" SSD/HDD and 1x 3.5" HDD.  
If you want to fit more than 1x 3.5" HDDs internally, look at these versions:  
2x HDDs: [Lenovo M710T](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=lenovo+%28m710t%2C720t%29+%287100%2C7400%2C7500%2C7700%2C8400%2C8500%2C8700%29&_sacat=179&LH_TitleDesc=0&_odkw=lenovo+%28m710t%2C720t%29+%287400%2C7500%2C7700%2C8400%2C8500%2C8700%29&_osacat=179&LH_BIN=1&_sop=15&_udhi=200) version (15.5L)

It's preferred to use an SSD for your OS drive and for storing Plex Metadata. You can either buy the system with an SSD included, or buy it bare, purchasing one separately as per the parts list below. The latter is preferrable as you have more control over size/brand/form factor.  

For media content storage, either use the HDD (if provided in the one you buy), replace it with a bigger one, or use external USB drives. You can get an 8TB drive for about $100, whether it be an 
internal [WD SATA drive](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_fsrp=1&rt=nc&_from=R40&_nkw=%28wd%2Cwestern%29+%288tb%2C10tb%2C12tb%2C14tb%2C16tb%2C18tb%2C20tb%29+-blue+-purple+-gold&_sacat=56083&LH_BIN=1&LH_TitleDesc=0&_sop=15&LH_ItemCondition=1000%7C1500) or an external [WD Elements/Easystore USB Drive](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Desktop-Hard-Drive-WDBWLG0080HBK-NESN/dp/B07D5V2ZXD). If you want to throw a bunch of drives at it (4) and not have all the USB/power cables of external drives, either go with one of the bigger cases or add a Terramaster [F4-210 NAS](/wiki/storage#pre-built-nas-list). If you want to go beyond this you'll want to build everything internally as per the NAS+Media Server sample build below.  

The optimal serving solution would be this system configured with a M.2 SSD for OS/apps, a large 3.5" internal HDD, Ubuntu 22, docker and the plex docker container.

Windows is fine for ease of administration, but you can go with Ubuntu or OpenMediaVault on the Linux-side for more advanced usage, like Docker, and/or have better disk volume management.  

See our [Storage Setup Guide](/wiki/storage) for more information on software, drives, and pre-built NASes.  

You can also optionally use this as a HTPC client. Add a used low-profile GT 1030 for 4k@60 HDR content.

### $650 Medium NAS / Media Server (19.5L) - New

This build can be seen as a culmination of the previous two builds, a media server and a NAS combined, while using new hardware.  

The Node 304 is tailor made for this kind of NAS and the Intel CPU will give you hardware media transcoding and video out for administration and even all-in-one use, if you really wanted.  

Nothing else here is too surprising. High value ram and ssd perform well and don't break the bank.  

This is configured below with 16TB of usable space with protection (8TBx3 = 24TB - 8TB parity drive = 16TB), but you can pack it all the way up to 110TB usable with protection (6x22TB-22TB parity). We use highly reliable, well-priced Ultrastar HDDs here. Alternatively, you can buy external USB WD Elements drives and [shuck](https://www.howtogeek.com/324769/how-to-get-premium-hard-drives-for-cheap-by-shucking-external-drives/) them, which will yield you  
similarly performing White drives. It's market-dependent which way is cheaper at any given time.  

If you want to bulk up past 6 drives, look at the Coolermaster N400 or Node 804 case for up to 10 drives, with a uATX motherboard and the optional 9207-8i HBA in the parts list.  

If used as a Plex server, you can [Direct Play](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200430303-streaming-overview/) a couple dozen stream and [transcode](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200430303-streaming-overview/) 6 concurrent 1080p streams with software transcoding. If you need more transcodes than that, do [hardware igpu transcoding](https://support.plex.tv/articles/115002178853-using-hardware-accelerated-streaming/) with a purchased Plex Pass and a linux docker/VM in Unraid. That'll get you 8x4k/17x1080p transcodes. Alternatively, if you didn't want to buy a Plex Pass, you could use an AMD Ryzen 5600/B550 mobo to get software transcoding for 10x1080p streams, but there's no video out on the CPU, so you'll need to add some sort of [cheap video card](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=radeon+4350&_sacat=0&_sop=15), at least for initial setup in Unraid, but can run it headless after that if you want.

### $4000 Almost Ultimate NAS (126TB) + Media Server (59L)

If you have massive storage requirements now, or plan on in the future, and don't want to go hot-swap or rackmount, this build will fit the bill. 
The Meshify 2 case is quality and well-priced for 13xHDDs and has fan slots up front to cool your data HDDs sufficiently, as when maxed out they will 
collectively produce a lot of heat. See our [Storage Setup Guide](/wiki/storage) for additional case options.  

The CPU may seem meager, not being a K sku, but we don't need much power, we mostly want the iGPU for hardware media transcoding and the Noctua cooler is 
more than enough for this 65W CPU. If you opt for the 12600K, move up to the Peerless Assassin cooler.  

We use highly reliable, well-priced Seagate Exos HDDs here for our data. Alternatively, WD Ultrastar drives are just as good. Since this is the bulk of our 
cost, find the best price you can and, if you can, order from multiple vendors to get different batches of drives.  

We configure for 126TB of usable space with dual-parity protection (14TBx11 = 154TB total - 28TB parity = 126TB usable).  

If you want to start with smaller-sized or a smaller number of drives and mix-and-match sizes later, you can do that, but your parity drive(s) should be 
as big as the largest usable data drive you plan on having. It is also not recommended to go over 6 usable data drives per parity drive.  

Keeping a backup of this much data would be a serious problem without building a second system to sync to, even if we do have a dual-parity protected array. 
If a backup is something you may want, consider splitting up the drives into 2 arrays. Such as 1 active array w/6 drives (5 usable+1 parity) and a backup 
array with 5 drives (5 usable+0 parity). Then sync the active array to the backup array nightly with something like rsync. With the configured drives, 
that'd give you 70TB usable and backed-up. If you wanted to make up for the lost usable space in such a configuration, you could go all the way up to 
20TB drives and have 100TB usable.  

For app/cache storage, such things as VMs, Docker data and media caching, we have 2 SSDs to create a 1TB parity-protected array (essentially a RAID1).  

Unraid will boot off the USB flash drive, so we have a decent one here. Consider buying an extra one as a backup.  

Lots of well-priced RAM for VMs, Dockers and, if you so choose, Plex media transcoding in RAM.  

As a Plex server, with the purchased Plex Pass, you can transcode 8x4k or 20x1080p transcodes concurrently on the CPU's iGPU. Without a Plex Pass, 
expect 8x1080p streams with CPU software transcoding. For more transcodes, add a used [Quadro P5000](https://www.elpamsoft.com/?p=Plex-Hardware-Transcoding) dGPU (11x4k,22x1080p) ($300).  

The LSI HBA adapter has 8 ports for SATA drives. You can use the 8x SATA ports on the motherboard, then add on the HBA when you outgrow those or vice-versa.  

For the motherboard, in theory any Z690/Z790 ATX/uATX board will work with 2 x16 slots, if you want to have support for a potential dGPU upgrade. We need at least 1 slot for our LSI HBA Adapter to connect our data drives to and then 1 slot for a potential dGPU. 
On the chosen board we also have dual 2.5Gb Intel LAN.

The PSU wattage may seem overkill, but we again plan for any upgrades, CPU, GPU, etc.. and remember that each HDD can pull 10W on spin-up.

### $150 Large NAS / Utility Server (36L) - Used

A step up from the previous Medium build in internal capacity, but still used hardware, so similar in cost. It's large and an old arch, but good for mass storage and other lightweight duties.  

This is a setup with hardware off ebay using the old Ivy Bridge architecture. Plenty of power for NAS and utility task duties. Yes, it can be used as a Plex media server as well for its [Direct Play](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200430303-streaming-overview/) 
and H264 transcode ability (look at the Dell 3620 option in the previous build for 4k/HEVC transcoding), but that's not our primary focus here. Our focus is internal storage capacity.  

This can fit 6x3.5 HDDs (using 3x3.5" and 3x5.25" mounts) officially. Since it has 6x SATA ports, you'll ideally use 1x for a SATA SSD for your OS and the other 5x for any data/cache HDDs. For raw storage 
this has you hovering in the realm of 40TB-100TB of storage potential depending on whether you go with well-priced 8/10TB drives all the way up to new, still-pricey 20TB drives. If you get creative with space, you can fit 8x 3.5" drives using a [9210-8i SAS->SATA HBA](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=9210+8i&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&_odkw=hp+cmt&_osacat=0&LH_PrefLoc=2) and [SATA Power Splitters](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Power-Y-Splitter-Inches/dp/B00V6QA65G).  

If you go with an i5/i7 version, you'll get non-ECC memory. With a Xeon version you can use ECC memory, which is better for data integrity. 
You should also have a battery-backup UPS as well if you really care about data integrity.  

If you want ease-of-use management, spend the extra $$ on [Unraid](https://unraid.net) as your OS and its web-based system for VMs and Docker containers. Otherwise, just use Linux/[OpenMediaVault](https://www.openmediavault.org/) and 
either set up drives as individual volumes or use [mergerFS](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs/wiki).  

If you can't find a HP Z220 CMT setup, you can alternatively go with a HP Z210 CMT.  

See our [Network Storage Guide](/wiki/storage) for more information on software and drives.

## Gaming Emulation builds

<!-- Sub-Section -->

### $100 720p/1080p Gaming Emulation Box (1.2L)

This is a good, small (Micro/USFF) emulation box for NES/SNES, Game Gear, Sega Master/Saturn/Dreamcast, PSP/PS1, N64/Gamecube, AtomisWave.  
3DS, PS2 and anything >= Wii will struggle, depending on the game. If you want to run those, move up to a i5-6500 SFF and low profile Nvidia GT 1030 GDDR5 used off ebay for $75 more; if you need to stay in the Micro/USFF form-factor, look at [AMD-based pre-builts](https://www.ebay.com/sch/179/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=%283200ge%2C3400ge%2C2400ge%2C3200ge%29&LH_TitleDesc=0&LH_BIN=1&_sop=15&_udhi=150%29+%28%24100%29+OR+%3E%3D+%5BJ4125+Mini+PC%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNucBox-Windows-Computer-Intel-J4125%2Fdp%2FB092JFVX2Z) ($175).  
This is not for anything like PS3, CEMU, or anything >= Xbox  

Make sure to get one with 2x4GB sticks of RAM, not a single stick.  

For your frontend, Batocera (linux) and LaunchBox/BigBox (windows) are good choices. Solus is good if you want a fully fledged linux interface.  

Will handle 1080p video duties fine

### $300 720p/1080p Gaming Emulation Box (13.9L)

Good for 720p internal resolution on emulators, [1080p up the Wii/Gamecube/PS2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J97MxOr9hu0&t=11s). Less demanding PS3 games are possible, but you might have to take down to 720p.  

Will handle 4k video duties just fine.  

This is a bottom-barrel build, due to Micro-ATX motherboard being cheaper, CPU a tick slower, a larger case and a smaller SSD.  

For better quality parts, see ALT: notes, for a better case, motherboard and separate PSU. @$60 more. For more oomph, see the $500 build below.  

For an even smaller box, you could go with the Asrock Deskmini A300W/X300W case at 1.9L. Skip motherboard and change ram to DDR4-3200 2x8GB SO-DIMMS. $30 more.  

If you don't want to build, you can find [SFF/USFF pre-builts on Ebay with the Ryzen 2400G/3400G](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=%283400ge%2C2400ge%2C2400g%2C3400g%29&_sacat=179&LH_TitleDesc=0&_odkw=%283400ge%2C2400ge%29&_osacat=179&LH_BIN=1&_sop=15&_udhi=150%29+%28%24100%29+OR+%3E%3D+%5BJ4125+Mini+PC%5D%28https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNucBox-Windows-Computer-Intel-J4125%2Fdp%2FB092JFVX2Z) for around $200, sometimes cheaper.

### $500 720p/1080p Gaming Emulation Box (3.3L)

This just uses a Ryzen 5600G APU, no dedicated GPU which is fine for light gaming and 4k video. A 5700G would give even better gaming performance.  

Emulation: You should be able to play at 45-60 fps for most everything at 720p internal resolution and <= 32-bit systems at 1080p. Demanding platforms (like Xbox 360) and 64-bit titles, like BoTW, expect <= 30 fps@1080p. You can push Wii/PS3 to 60 fps@1080p, w/BoTW up to 50 fps at the extreme limits of a 5700G. Check out ETA PRIME's [5600G](https://youtu.be/wH0Gpk7Hi3A?t=558) and [5700G](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h66gd8kVlZ0) reviews for actual game data.  

Gaming: Expect 50 fps@1080p Med for most games, with a 5600G/5700G pushing that up to 60 fps@1080p Med sans harder games like Doom Eternal/Cyberpunk/etc.. which you'll have to run at 720p low. Check out ETA PRIME's [5600G](https://youtu.be/wH0Gpk7Hi3A?t=558) and [5700G](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImrIc0PJEDw) reviews for actual game data.  

For an even smaller box, you could go with the Asrock Deskmini A300W/X300W at 1.9L as shown in the Notes column. And it comes out to about $45 cheaper since you don't need to buy a motherboard. Everything else stays the same.  

For a fanless build, with same perf., for $250 more, see build in HTPC section above

### $225 1080p Gaming Steam Box - USED

This budget gaming build runs on Manjaro Linux w/Steam.  
It's good for 1080p, High @ 60 fps+ on normal games, Medium @ 45-60 fps on AAA games.  
It uses a Pre-built PC and GPU from Ebay. Prices are for buying via auction/Best Offer. Buy It Now will cost you more.  
Make sure you pick a GPU with a 6-pin (not 8) power connector and a PC with 2 sata connectors free for GPU power.  
The Dell 7040/7050/3620 or Lenovo M900 is good for the i7-6700. You can usually find one with an M.2 SSD so you don't have to purchase one separately.  
Manjaro linux that we use here is fine for Steam and comes pre-installed with it. Simply download the Manjaro KDE Plasma iso, write it to the USB key with Etcher, boot from it and install to the SSD. You can then Enable Proton (experimental version) in Steam preferences.  
Alternatively, you can run Windows if you want, and you have an activation key.

### $800 VR Box (11.5L)

The Silverstone case is a very good value, and does its job. Yes, it's no fancy Louqe Ghost, but neither is the price.  

We do go with a small SFX PSU here for more room, and it's not much more than a good full modular ATX PSU.  

You can also add a 3.5" HDD for an HTPC variation of this build, as long as you stick with the SFX PSU and the 120mm AIO. Any bigger and you run out of room quickly, especially for cables.  

You can however go with the thicker H80i AIO if you want to beef up your CPU cooling with an extra fan, though it isn't required. If you're not keen on AIO cooling, then a Noctua NH-L12S will fit fine with the SFX PSU.  

For CPU/MOBO you can replace AMD Ryzen with Intel i5-12400F/B660, if availability is a problem  

We chose a pretty small GPU here, but you can just as easily choose one all the way up to 270mm in length, but still dual-slot. The Radeon RX 6600/RTX 2060 is good for 1080p VR, but expect to jump to the RX 6650 XT/RTX 2060 Super or higher for 1440p.

### $850 VR Box - Sandwich Case Variation (9.7L)

The $800 VR Box with a Geeek sandwich case. A little bit smaller than the SG13B.  

This changes the CPU cooler, PSU and fan compatibility. We can also use a longer GPU.  

For CPU/MOBO you can replace AMD with Intel i5-12400F/B660, if availability is a problem  

The Radeon RX 6600/RTX 2060 is good for 1080p VR, but expect to jump to the RX 6650 XT/RTX 2060 Super or higher for 1440p.
