This setup guide is only for HDR10 passthrough. High-end tonemapping is not discussed here. Dolby Vision/HDR10**+** is not discussed here as **no passthrough options exist** on PC. Read our [HDR section](/wiki/faq#what-is-hdr-video-and-what-do-i-need-to-take-advantage-of-it) in the Wiki FAQ for detailed information and requirements.  
We assume your display, video chain and media player have already been configured/calibrated properly for non-HDR content before you venture into the HDR setup below. If not, you are urged to follow the setup sections in the [Video Setup](/wiki/video#setup) wiki page first.  
You are **strongly urged** to test out the simple setups below before potentially moving onto the advanced ones.

            * HDR: Auto display: used for fullscreen/always used  
            * OPTIONAL: Chroma/Upscaling
              * NOTE: To use these, you must uncheck the four DXVA2/D3D11 video processors. GPU usage will increase as you go down the list of scaling options.
              * Chroma/Upscaling: [Choose](/wiki/video#what-are-the-best-algorithms-for-scaling-video)
            * OPTIONAL: Downscaling

If "Frames" shows significant skipped frames, your GPU isn't powerful enough. [If the colors in your video are washed out](https://i.imgur.com/AD6lOIS.jpg), either you don't have proper PC/TV hardware support for HDR, aren't using HDMI 2.x ports, or don't have TV deep color configured.

## MADVR PERFORMANCE SETTINGS PER GPU

WARNING: These settings are for more intensive image processing/scaling that is NOT necessary for just HDR passthrough.  
The settings for the corresponding GPU families below are a little conservative so you don't have to spend hours wasting your time with stuttering due to high rendering times and diminishing returns.  
This doesn't mean that they're not gpu intensive; they most certainly are. Test with the default settings before changing to any of these.  
If you can't handle the GPU load/noise/heat these settings produce, turn them down or go back to the madvr Bilinear defaults.
