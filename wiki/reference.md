This is a list of terms you may find on this subreddit and what they mean

---

**4K** - See: UHD

**AAC/HE-AAC** - Multi-channel audio codecs. Part of the MPEG-2/MPEG-4 specs. Competitor to Dolby and DTS. Successor to MP3

**AC-3** - Synonymous with Dolby Digital 5.1

**APU** - Accelerated Processing Unit. The term AMD gives to their CPU packages that have a GPU built-in. Common ones are Ryzen 2x00G-8x00G (med. perf/power), Athlon 2x0GE/3000G (low perf/power), A4/A6/A8/A10/A12 (last gen), Athlon 5xxx (old).

**ARC/eARC (audio)** - Audio Return Channel. A feature in the HDMI spec that allows audio to flow from a HDMI sink (e.g. TV) back to a sound system. This is useful when an HTPC/media device is connected to a TV first which then has to passthrough the HTPC audio (or its own audio) back to the sound system. ARC (HDMI 1.4/2.0) supports 2.0 PCM uncompressed and AC-3+Atmos/DTS 5.1 compressed audio. eARC (HDMI 2.1) support up to Dolby Atmos/DTS:X uncompressed audio. ARC almost never supported on HTPC/media device GPU ports, only on Displays and sound systems.

**ARC (Intel)** - Family of dedicated video cards made by Intel. Supports DP 1.4a/2.0, HDMI 2.0b/2.1, 4k netflix, AV1 decoding/encoding.

**AV1** - An open, royalty-free video codec. Lossy compression. The successor to and 20-40% more efficient than VP9/HEVC. Not widely used as of 2021; found in some Youtube/Netflix content. Supported by Intel >= 11xxG/11xxx, >= Arc 3, Nvidia >= RTX 30-series, AMD >= RX 66xx, >= Ryzen 6xxxU, >= Ryzen 7xxx.  

**AVC** - A video codec synonymous with H.264/mpeg-4.

**AVR** - Audio/Video Receiver. A piece of hardware that receives multiple audio/video input signals (from a HTPC/Blu-ray player/Video game console/etc..), amplifies audio, applies audio processing, delivers audio to speakers and video to output devices such as TVs.

**DisplayPort/DP** - An interface for transporting audio/video. Commonly used to connect devices in a Home Theater setting, but not nearly as common as HDMI. As TVs and AVRs tend to have HDMI ports, DisplayPorts that are found on HTPCs are usually used in conjunction with a DisplayPort->HDMI adapter when a HDMI 2.0 port is not found on the motherboard to get HDMI 2.0 output. The current standard is DisplayPort 1.4

**E-AC-3** - Synonymous with Dolby Digital Plus 5.1

**FPS** - Frames Per Second. This is used for video output in reference to how many content frames are recorded/shown/transmitted per second. A higher number usually translates to smoother video.

The gold standard today in HTPCs is 4k@60FPS. Common rates relating to HTPCs are:

RATE|USE|NOTES
:--|:--|:--
23.976/24|Movies|Usually upconverted to 60i for TVs through a process known as 2:3/3:2 pulldown.
25|Broadcast TV (outside US/Central America/SE Asia)|Standard used in PAL color-encoding for 576i
29.97/30|Broadcast TV (US/Central America/SE Asia), HTPC|Standard used in NTSC color-encoding. Interlaced to 60 fps for TV
60|HTPC and TV Display|60i (cable/sat), 60p (HTPC, media devices)

**Form Factor** - An aspect of hardware design typically relating to the size and shape of components. Commonly used in HTPCs for cases and motherboards.

**GPU/iGPU** - Graphics Processing Unit. A video card. The 'i' in iGPU stands for 'Internal/Integrated'. This is a GPU that is included on the CPU package, prevelant in Intel CPUs (HD xxx) and AMD APUs (Radeon/Vega).

**GTX/RTX 10xx/16xx/20xx/30xx/40xx** - Families of high-end graphics cards made by Nvidia. There are various versions, 1030/1050/1060/1070/1080 ($75-$500), 1650/1660 ($150-$250), 2060/2070/2080 ($350-$1200), 3070/3080 ($500-$700). They are currently one of the only graphics card families to support HDMI 2.0, HDCP 2.2 and Microsoft Playready 3 (outside of Intel iGPUs >= 7th gen, AMD APUs >= 3200G and AMD dGPUs >= RX 4xx) for DRM use to access 4K Netflix. RTX 30xx adds support for HDMI 2.1

**H.264** - A video codec. Also called AVC. Lossy compression. Used by Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Vimeo, Youtube, iTunes and various HDTV broadcasts. Used in blu-ray discs. Widely supported since the early 2010s.

**H.265/HEVC** - A video codec that is the successor to H.264. Lossy compression. Better quality for same bitrate. Used by Netflix. Used in UHD blu-ray discs. Supported by >= Intel Kaby/Apollo Lake, >= Intel ARC 3, AMD Ryzen APUs/dGPUs >= RX 4xx, >= Nvidia GTX 10-series

**HDCP** - High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection. A copy-protection/DRM scheme found in audio/video streams to protect content from unauthorized duplication. Commonly found in DVD, Blu-ray, Netflix and other major streaming content and used over HDMI, DisplayPort and DVI video interfaces. Each hardware device (HTPC, AVR, TV, etc..) in the content chain must be HDCP compliant for the stream to be accessible. For a HTPC, this usually means the CPU, GPU, video interface, OS and ultimately your output device (typically a TV). The current standard is HDCP 2.2.

**HDMI** - High-Definition Multimedia Interface. An interface for transporting audio/video. Commonly used to connect devices in a Home Theater setting. The current standard is HDMI 2.1.

**HDR video** - High Dynamic Range video. A technology used to produce better looking video by preserving details in the darkest and lightest portions of a frame resulting in better contrast. For a HTPC, this means HDR support must be in the video, GPU, video interface (HDMI/DP) and ultimately your output device (typically a TV). Check the [FAQ](/wiki/faq#what-is-hdr-video-and-what-do-i-need-to-take-advantage-of-it) for GPUs that support HDR. Common standards are HDR10, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision.

**HTPC** - Home Theater Personal Computer. Why you are here!

**Hz** - Hertz. Commonly referred to as Refresh Rate. Ideally Hz >= FPS. It's still common for Refresh Rate to be multiple times the FPS. For instance, you can have 60 Hz and 30 FPS in which the output device will display each frame twice. This is most commonly used for video output and a higher number means less video flicker and higher image stability.

The gold standard today in HTPCs for media is 120 Hz. For high end gaming, 120 Hz is desirable. Common rates relating to HTPCs are:

RATE|USE|NOTES
:--|:--|:--
24|NTSC|For judder reduction of 24p content (movies, almost all 1080p bluray)
30|NTSC|Older TVs use this. For 30fps
50|PAL|For 25fps
60|NTSC|Majority of budget TVs use this. Used for 60fps
120|NA|Used in higher-end TVs for better motion because 24fps movies evenly multiplies to 120 therefore does not need 2:3 pulldown
240|NA|Used to simulate even better motion by rapidly turning the TV backlight off and on at an additional 120 Hz

**Judder** - A common display artifact caused by playing 24p content on a display with a refresh rate (typically 60hz) that doesn't equally divide by the frame rate. This causes stuttering in horizontal motion and panning scenes as the display uses a method called 'pulldown' to fit the frames into the refresh rate. Typical workarounds are switching the display into 24Hz mode or using a display with a true refresh rate that divides equally (such as 120Hz).

**madVR** - A DirectShow video renderer usually added to video players (like kodi, mpc-hc, etc..) to enhance video content using GPU computing power. This includes, but is not limited to, passthrough and processing/tonemapping of HDR metadata for displays, HQ image upscaling/downscaling, chroma upscaling, artifact removal, image enhancement, smooth motion, dithering and deinterlacing.

**MP3** - A multi-channel audio codec. Generally stereo up to 320Kbps. Succeeded by AAC.

**NAS** - Network Attached Storage. A device that holds 1 or more disks connected to a network for serving media to clients over said network. For HTPC use, an example would be a NAS with 4 disks in a RAID 5 configuration. Media would be shared using a file share, which is accessed by something like Plex Media Server or a Kodi client. Fully featured NASes also have the ability to run media services on them like a media server, media grabbing software, VPN, etc..

**NTSC** - National Television System Committee. Television color-encoding for 480i. 60hz. Usually used in the US/Central America and northern parts of South America.

**NUC** - Next Unit of Computing. A 4x4 form factor for PCs, developed by Intel. Also used to reference an actual PC of this form factor. They usually have an external power supply, a VESA mount and simply require you to add memory and storage for a complete system.

**OTA** - Over the Air. Terrestrial services (usually TV) via RF Antennas. Analog until 2009. 

**PAL** - Phase Alternating Line. Television Color-encoding for 576i. 50 Hz, 25fps. Usually used outside US/Central America and northern parts of South America.

**RAID** - Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks. A technology used in media storage to provide scale-ability or redundancy/resiliency against loss of data due to storage medium (typically disks) failure. Typically found on storage in NAS devices and internal storage on high-end HTPCs. Popular forms are RAID 0 (for scale-ability), RAID 1 (for redundancy), RAID 5 (for scale-ability+redundancy).

**Raven Ridge/Picasso/Renoir/Cezanne** - AMD's 2xxx/3xxx/4xxx/5xxx series of "G" APUs based on their Zen architecture (2017-). These integrate a GPU into the CPU package.

**RTX** - See GTX

**RX 4xx/5xx** - Older generation family of mid-level graphics cards made by AMD. It is one of the graphics card families to support HDMI 2.0, HDCP 2.2 and Microsoft Playready 3 for DRM use to access 4K Netflix.

**RX Vega/Navi/5xxx/6xxx/7xxx** - Families of graphics cards made by AMD. Vega (2017-) is found in AMD APUs in various forms, supporting HDMI 2.0 and HDR. Also found in dedicated GPUs in the form of Vega 56/64, succeeding the RX 4xx/5xx families. Navi (2019) succeeds Vega with RDNA 1 and includes the RX 5x00 dedicated GPUs. Navi is one of the graphics card families to support HDMI 2.0, HDCP 2.2 and Microsoft Playready 3 for DRM use to access 4K Netflix. RDNA 2 include RX 6xx0 dedicated GPUs and Ryzen 7xxx iGPUs, and adds support for HDMI 2.1. RDNA 3 include RX 7x00 dedicated GPUs and adds support for DP 2.1.
