### SETUP GUIDE #1

From [thread:How to get full HD 3D frame packing from a PC or a Mac in 2023 - The ultimate guide](https://reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/115ap94/how_to_get_full_hd_3d_frame_packing_from_a_pc_or/)  
By: [/u/Baboulinet34](https://reddit.com/user/Baboulinet34)  

**TL;DR: All you need is:**

* A PC (Windows, but Linux should be fine too) or an Intel Mac (M1/M2 Macs not compatible as of today / early 2023)
* A software such as:
   * Stereoscopic Player (Windows only)
   * MPC-BE + madVR (Windows only)
   * sView (Windows / Linux / macOS)
   * Bino 3D (Windows / Linux / macOS)
* And of course, a projector/TV supporting full HD 3D frame packing

**Side note:** Please note that this guide focuses on 1080/24p full HD 3D because this is only what my old BenQ W1070 full HD projector supports. If you own a recent 4K projector, you might be able to get 1080/60p full HD 3D.

##### 1. Intro

I recently wanted to play a full HD 3D movie at home with the devices I already have (BenQ W1070 projector, an Apple TV, a Windows 11 laptop PC, a 2020 M1 MacBook Air or a 2015 Intel MacBook Pro) and I didn’t know it will be such a nightmare to do this. It turned out 3D has been more or less abandoned these last few years by the industry and devices that once supported 3D frame packing output such as Nvidia GPUs no longer do. So, I ended up searching for days for a solution, and after already having tried a lot of things and almost giving up, I came across this post: [https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4081957?answerId=19358529022](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4081957?answerId=19358529022)

It looked like something could be done, so I continued to search and tried a shit load of things for days, until I got it sorted out.

Some people might be in the position I was, so I wanted to share my journey and the solutions that actually work, so you won’t have to waste days on this.

First of all, why bother getting full HD 3D to work and not just use a half Side-by-Side or a half Over Under (or Top and Above) file, play it at 1080p like any non-3D file with VLC, Plex, or any other player, and put the projector on 3D Side by Side or Over Under mode and call it a day?

Well, because in terms of image quality it is day and night.

With a full SBS file (3840x1080) or full OU file (1920x2160) played in frame packing mode, you get a full resolution image of 1920x1080 for both eyes, whereas with a half SBS (1920x1080) or a half OU (1920x1080 also) you only get half of that (960x1080 or 1920x540 for each eye, the projector then stretches that out to 1920x1080 but half of the resolution is lost initially). You may ask why not play a full SBS file in 1080p on the projector and put the 3D Side by Side or Over Under mode? Because even if the file native resolution is 3840x1080, it will be squeezed to 1920x1080 before being sent to the projector, resulting in an image quality roughly the same than with a half SBS file.

So, let’s get to it.

##### 2. First step: Get your PC/Mac to output a 1920x2205 24Hz signal to your projector

##### 2.1. Some details before the actual how-to

As you might already know, frame packing (first introduced with HDMI 1.4 or 1.4a if I’m not mistaking) consists of 2 1080p images (left eye and right eye), one below the other, with 45 pixels of blank between the 2 images, resulting in a 1920x2205 resolution.

![img1a](https://preview.redd.it/8r8f5vi9rwia1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52edabbfe155bbbfca5bdff6b9477d0661c21551)

![img1b](https://preview.redd.it/8r8f5vi9rwia1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52edabbfe155bbbfca5bdff6b9477d0661c21551)

The only way to get real full HD 3D is with this frame packing method. As the user manual of my BenQ W1070 shows, this projector only supports frame packing mode at 1080p 24Hz. It also supports frame sequential mode (images of each eye are sent alternatively) but only at 720p 60Hz, so not in full HD. Most full HD 3D projector should have similar specs.

Usually, when using frame packing, you won’t even see the projector displaying this weird resolution. The playback device connected to the projector, a Blu-ray player, a PlayStation or an Xbox for example, which officially supports a 3D frame packing output through HDMI, will send a special signal to the projector which will then automatically toggle the 3D frame packing mode on.

In our case, since Macs or PCs with modern GPUs don’t seem to officially support a 3D frame packing output through HDMI anymore, we will have to manually put the project at a 1920x2205 resolution and then manually activate the 3D frame packing mode in the projector’s menu itself.

##### 2.2. How-to put your projector at 1920x2205 24Hz

1920x2205 is not a standard resolution, you will need a software to force this as a custom resolution.

##### 2.2.1. On a Mac

The most known software is SwitchResX ([https://www.madrau.com](https://www.madrau.com)) but you can also try EasyRes ([https://apps.apple.com/us/app/easyres/id688211836](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/easyres/id688211836)), BetterDisplay ([https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay)) or any similar software.

As of today, only Intel Macs will be able to output custom resolutions. M1/M2 Macs will only output scaled resolutions, you won’t be able to get the 1920x2205 resolution to work (as you can see in the FAQ of SwitchResX: [https://www.madrau.com/support/support/faq\_files/ns\_Is\_SwitchResX\_compatible\_with\_A.html](https://www.madrau.com/support/support/faq_files/ns_Is_SwitchResX_compatible_with_A.html)). I tried at least 6 or 7 tools like SwitchResX on my M1 MacBook Air with no success. On an Intel Mac it works like a charm.

##### 2.2.2. On a Windows PC

With a Nvidia GPU you can use the Nvidia Control Panel: [https://www.nvidia.com/content/Control-Panel-Help/vLatest/en-us/mergedProjects/nvdsp/To\_create\_custom\_timings\_for\_your\_HDTV\_display.htm](https://www.nvidia.com/content/Control-Panel-Help/vLatest/en-us/mergedProjects/nvdsp/To_create_custom_timings_for_your_HDTV_display.htm)

With an Intel GPU you can use the Intel Graphic Command Center: [https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000056144/graphics/legacy-graphics.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000056144/graphics/legacy-graphics.html)

With an AMD GPU you can do that too I guess but I couldn’t try personally.

You can also use a dedicated tool like Custom Resolution Utility: [https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU](https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU)

Finally, you can also automatically set custom resolutions with madVR (but it wasn’t working properly for me), see below for more details.

##### 2.2.3. How to know what the values will be for the front porch / sync width / back porch / etc.?

The way I figured this out for my projector was by looking at the details of the 1920x1080 24Hz resolution with SwitchResX on my Mac (on a Windows PC, I don’t know if you can check the details of a natively supported resolution with the Nvidia Control Panel, but maybe you can with Custom Resolution Utility) and then by modifying the values to get to the 1920x2205 resolution. If I remember correctly, I only changed the “vertical active lines” from 1080 to 2205, the other values were then automatically adjusted by SwitchResX.

BenQ W1070 at 1920x1080 24Hz:

![img2a](https://preview.redd.it/1g7p484brwia1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3716ccf7004a3e689f105b75096d8cb7579456f)

BenQ W1070 at 1920x2205 24Hz:

![img2b](https://preview.redd.it/82hyvf9crwia1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea69d711760127f0dfcbf527f6604d5a8c6be800)

You will then be able to activate this 1920x2205 resolution, your projector will display this weird resolution. With 3D mode off, you will still see a 16:9 image displayed and you will see the middle of the 1920x2205 image and the 45 pixels of blank. You won’t be able to see the top of the Windows desktop or the bottom and the Windows taskbar. With 3D frame packing mode on and your 3D glasses on, you will see the top of the desktop with one eye and the bottom of the desktop with the other eye.

Now, let’s choose a software to play some full HD 3D movies 🥳


##### 3. Second step: choose your player based on your OS and audio system

##### 3.1. Which player to use based on your needs

Windows, you need surround sound and your audio receiver can handle surround PCM: Stereoscopic Player, MPC-BE + madVR, sView or Bino 3D

Windows, you need surround sound and your audio receiver can’t handle surround PCM: Stereoscopic Player or MPC-BE + madVR

Windows, you don’t need surround sound: Stereoscopic Player, MPC-BE + madVR, sView or Bino 3D

Intel Mac, you need surround sound and your audio receiver can handle surround PCM: sView or Bino 3D

Intel Mac, you need surround sound and your audio receiver can’t handle surround PCM: Nothing I’m aware of…

Intel Mac, you don’t need surround sound: sView or Bino 3D

M1/M2 Mac: Nothing because you can’t output a 1920x2205 resolution

Please see “6. Notes about surround sound if you have a sound card with support for 5.1 through 3 analog jacks or with support for Dolby Digital Live / DTS Interactive” if you’re in this case, as you might be able to get surround sound, both on a Mac or on a Windows PC, even with sView and Bino 3D, even if your audio receiver can’t handle surround PCM.

##### 3.2. Players details and some important notes about each one of them

##### 3.2.1. Stereoscopic Player

* This one is clearly the best player thanks to the ease of use and thanks to the use of external filters / audio decoders / video decoders like LAV Filters or ffdshow. This is the player I sticked with.
* Download: [https://www.3dtv.at/Products/Player/Index\_en.aspx](https://www.3dtv.at/Products/Player/Index_en.aspx)
* OS: Windows Only
* Paid, with a free trial
* Important notes:
   * Stereoscopic Player comes with LAV Filters but I suggest to uninstall it from the Windows Control Panel and then install the very last version: [https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases)
      * Make sure to install the x86/32-bit version
   * If needed (see below in “Audio output”), you can also install the last version of ffdshow ([https://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/download.php](https://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/download.php))
      * Also make sure to install the x86/32-bit version
   * Stereoscopic Player won’t be able to use the x64/64-bit versions
* Supported files:
   * **IMPORTANT:** H265 .mkv have to be renamed .mp4 to play, or else you will get an error message
   * Every .mkv / .mp4 3D formats, both in H264 and H265, play correctly
   * BD ISOs not playing directly
   * SSIF files (from BD ISOs) play correctly
* Audio output:
   * Allow bitstream / audio passthrough thanks to LAV Audio Decoder or ffdshow, so you can get your audio receiver to decode a surround DTS or Dolby Digital stream instead of getting an uncompressed PCM stream
      * This is very useful if your audio receiver doesn’t support 5.1 PCM like my Logitech Z-5450 which only supports stereo with PCM
      * Open the “LAV Audio Configuration” or ffdshow “Audio Decoder Configuration” control panel from the Start Menu to activate audio passthrough (“Audio Settings” tab for LAV and “Output” menu for ffdshow)
   * You can use LAV primarily, but ffdshow comes with one advantage: the ability to encode in AC3/Dolby Digital any other 5.1 format. This is useful if your audio receiver only supports classic Dolby Digital and DTS but not Dolby Digital Plus or DTS-HS or Dolby True HD or multichannel AAC, like my Logitech Z-5450.
      * You can activate this in the ffdshow “Audio Decoder Configuration” control panel → Output → “Output format for uncompressed or decoded streams” and check “AC3 (S/PDIF encode mode)” and “Encode 5.1 streams only”
   * Make sure to also configure your preferred audio decoder in Stereoscopic Player settings → Decoder → Preferred Filters tab for each audio codec
* What mode to select for 3D frame packing output:
   * Make sure to select the right original layout of your file in File → Layout. For example, “Side by Side, Left Image First” for a full SBS .mkv. This should be auto-selected but if needed you can manually select what you wish.
   * In “View”, select:
      * “Over/Under, Left Image Top” in “Viewing Method”
      * You usually don’t need to change anything in “Viewing Method Options”
      * “Stereoscopic” in “Preferred Viewing Method”

##### 3.2.2. sView

* Download: Search for "sView" on Google → first result
* OS: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android
* Free
* Important notes:
   * For sView on Windows, there are “sView Image Player” and “sView Movie Player” installed. Make sure to open “sView Movie Player”.
* Supported files:
   * Every .mkv / .mp4 3D formats, both in H264 and H265, play correctly
   * BD ISOs not playing directly
   * SSIF files (from BD ISOs) play in 2D with an error message, no 3D
* Audio output:
   * sView won’t be able to do bitstream / audio passthrough. Audio is always decoded to PCM, so if your audio receiver doesn’t support 5.1 PCM, you won’t get surround sound.
      * I couldn’t find a workaround to get audio passthrough, even after a few emails back and forth with the developer of sView
   * For sView on Windows, if your audio receiver supports 5.1 PCM, make sure to check the option “force 5.1 audio output” (or similar) during the installation
* What mode to select for 3D frame packing output:
   * Make sure to select the right original layout of your file in “Media” → “Stereoscopic format”. For example, “Parallel Pair” for a full SBS .mkv. This should be auto-selected but if needed you can manually select what you wish.
   * In “View” → “Stereo Output” select “Stereo”
   * In the menu between “View” and “Help”, go to “Change device” and select “TV (parallel pair)”. You might have to quit/reopen sView after the change.
   * Then click on “TV (parallel pair)” between “View” and “Help”
      * In “FPS Control”, uncheck “Reduce CPU usage” or your movie will stutter
      * In “Layout”, choose “Top-and-Bottom \[HDMI\]” (this choice will only be shown if sView detects a monitor / projector with a 1920x2205 resolution)
   * **IMPORTANT:** the selected output layout / stereoscopic view will usually only be applied when sView is in fullscreen

##### 3.2.3. Bino 3D 1.6.x

* Download: [https://bino3d.org/download/](https://bino3d.org/download/)
* OS: Windows, macOS, Linux
* Free
* Important notes:
   * Make sure to select your projector in Bino 3D settings → “Plein ecran” or “Fullscreen” → “Single screen”
* Supported files:
   * The old 1.6.x version works on Windows and macOS (even on Ventura) but is buggy for H265 SBS files:
      * H264 Half SBS: ok
      * H265 Half SBS: right image cut in half
      * H264 Full SBS: ok
      * H265 Full SBS: right image cut in half
      * H264 Half OU: ok
      * H265 Half OU: ok
      * H264 Full OU: ok
      * H265 Full OU: ok
   * Maybe the new 2.x version is not buggy anymore for these files but at the moment it is only available on Linux and I wasn’t able to test it. The developer sent me a 2.x version Windows binary he had crossed-compiled with the Linux binary but it couldn’t play any file at all. The sources are available, you can try to compile it yourself.
   * BD ISOs or SSIF files (from BD ISOs): not playing
* Audio output:
   * Same than for sView, see above for more details
* What mode to select for 3D frame packing output:
   * Make sure to select the right original layout of your file in “Entree:” or “Input” of the main window. For example, “gauche/droite” or “left/right” for a full SBS .mkv. This should be auto-selected but if needed you can manually select what you wish.
   * In “Output:” of the main window, select “Haut/bas” or “Top/bottom”

##### 3.2.4. MPC-BE + madVR

* With MPC-BE + madVR you can achieve, for free, a similar experience than with Stereoscopic Player and it’s much more customizable. However, it’s much more complicated to get it to work properly.
* Download:
   * MPC-BE: [https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/mpcbe/9PD88QB3BGKN](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/mpcbe/9PD88QB3BGKN)
   * madVR [https://www.videohelp.com/software/madVR/old-versions#download](https://www.videohelp.com/software/madVR/old-versions#download)
* OS: Windows Only
* Free
* Side notes:
   * MPC-BE (Media Player Classic - Black Edition) is the successor of the well-known MPC-HC (HC for Home Cinema) which is not in development anymore
   * madVR stands for “madVideoRenderer”
* Important notes:
   * Make sure to download the beta version of madVR which is now called “madVRhdrMeasure”
      * The last madVR "legacy" version 0.92.17 which dates back to 2018 had a bug on my computer. In “display modes”, even if “switch to matching display mode…” and “restore original display mode…” were unchecked, madVR was forcing my projector back to 1920x1080. madVRhdrMeasure 1.6.6 didn’t have this bug.
      * Strangely, madVRhdrMeasure doesn’t have an installer. If MPC-BE doesn’t see madVR in the video renderer list in its settings, I suggest to download madVR "legacy" version 0.92.17, unzip it and install it (there is an “install” file in the folder, copy the folder somewhere it won’t be deleted, then open the install file). Once done, download madVRhdrMeasure 1.6.6, unzip it and copy/paste the files in your previous madVR folder.
   * madVR supports custom resolutions (or “custom modes”) on its own, so you can let madVR deal with this instead of going in the Nvidia Control Panel for example
      * See [https://madvr.com/crt/CustomResTutorial.html](https://madvr.com/crt/CustomResTutorial.html) for more information
      * For some reason, I couldn’t use this functionality on my computer, when going on the “display modes” of my projector, I could see the “custom modes” tab next to the “display modes” tab for half a second then it disappeared
   * Make sure to install the last version of LAV Filters ([https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/LAVFilters/releases)) and ffdshow ([https://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/download.php](https://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/download.php))
      * Make sure to install the x86/32-bit versions
      * If you wonder what’s the difference between LAV Splitter vs. LAV Splitter Source (you will see both in MPC-BE “external filters”): [https://bypureland.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/lav-splitter-vs-lav-splitter-source-%E8%BD%89%E8%BC%89/](https://bypureland.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/lav-splitter-vs-lav-splitter-source-%E8%BD%89%E8%BC%89/)
   * I won’t go into details for MPC-BE and madVR, you can find guides online, such as this one: [https://www.avsforum.com/threads/advanced-mpc-hc-setup-guide.1357375/](https://www.avsforum.com/threads/advanced-mpc-hc-setup-guide.1357375/)
* Supported files:
   * Every .mkv / .mp4 3D formats, both in H264 and H265, play correctly
   * BD ISOs or SSIF files (from BD ISOs): play correctly if I remember correctly
* Audio output:
   * Same than for Stereoscopic Player, see above for more details


##### 4. What about .mkv MVC files?

I’m not familiar with this format, but the players mentioned above (or at least Stereoscopic Player and MPC-BE + madVR) should play this correctly.


##### 5. Important notes about audio configuration an macOS and Windows

Please note that these settings are only useful for PCM streams sent to your audio receiver (with sView or Bino 3D for example), not for bitstream / audio passthrough.

* If your audio receiver supports 5.1 (or more) PCM audio, make sure to configure these settings properly
* If your audio receiver doesn’t support 5.1 PCM audio (like my Logitech Z-5450 which only support stereo PCM), these settings won’t help you to get a 5.1 PCM stream to play correctly on your speakers as it is technically not possible
   * If so, I suggest to configure these settings with “stereo speakers” instead of “5.1 surround speakers”, this way you will hear the 5.1 audio downmixed to stereo and you will hear the front center channel and voices
   * If you configure “5.1 surround speakers” and your audio receiver doesn’t support it, you will only hear the front left and right channels, you won’t hear the front center channel and voices at all, nor the rear left and right channels

Please see “6. Notes about surround sound if you have a sound card with support for 5.1 through 3 analog jacks or with support for Dolby Digital Live / DTS Interactive” if you’re in this case, as you might be able to get surround sound, both on a Mac or on a Windows PC, even with sView and Bino 3D, even if your audio receiver can’t handle surround PCM.

##### 5.1. macOS

Press cmd + space to open Spotlight and search for the “Audio MIDI Setup” app then open it. Select your audio output which goes to your audio receiver, click “Configure Speakers” then configure your audio setup properly.

##### 5.2. Windows

Press Win + R to open the “Run Dialog Box” then type **control mmsys.cpl sounds** and press Enter. Select your audio output which goes to your audio receiver, click “Configure” then configure your audio setup properly.

##### 6. Notes about surround sound if you have a sound card with support for 5.1 through 3 analog jacks or with support for Dolby Digital Live / DTS Interactive

The above explanations suppose you’re outputting audio through HDMI, along with the video signal. With my Logitech Z-5450, I use an audio extractor with an HDMI in and an HDMI out + Toslink S/PDIF out. My Mac or Windows PC HDMI out goes to the extractor’s HDMI in, the HDMI out then goes to my projector and the Toslink S/PDIF out goes to my Logitech.

This way I can get my Logitech to output surround sound as it can decodes Dolby Digital and DTS. Unfortunately, my Logitech only supports stereo with PCM, and as seen previously this can be a problem when using players like sView or Bino 3D as they don’t support bitstream / audio passthrough.

This problem can be solved with a 5.1 dedicated sound card, which can either be:

* Directly integrated to your motherboard (Windows PC only)
* A PCIe sound card added to your motherboard (Windows PC only)
* An external USB sound card (Mac and Windows PC)

If your audio receiver doesn’t have 5.1 analog jacks and only has a Toslink S/PDIF input, your only option will be Dolby Digital Live or DTS Interactive.

* This will be a Windows only solution, as Dolby Digital Live or DTS Interactive usually are only Windows compatible
* Your sound card must be supporting Dolby Digital Live or DTS Interactive
* Dolby Digital Live or DTS Interactive will re-encode on the fly audio stream like 5.1 PCM, so that it can outputs Dolby Digital or DTS to your audio receiver through a Toslink cable

If your audio receiver has 5.1 analog jacks (like my Logitech Z-5450 does), and your sound card also has these jacks, you’ll be able to get surround sound both from a Mac or a Windows PC:

* With whatever audio stream (Dolby Digital, DTS or even 5.1 PCM)
* Even if your audio receiver originally doesn’t support 5.1 PCM
* Because your audio receiver won’t be handling the decoding, which will now be handled by the sound card itself which then will output the 5.1 audio through the 3 analog jacks

If you don’t already have a dedicated sound card and are in a case where you need one to get 5.1 audio, you can get a Creative Sound Blaster X3 or X4 (external USB sound cards) as it seems to be the best bang for your buck as of today / early 2023.

##### 7. GPUs that might still officially support a real 3D frame packing output

As you might know, Nvidia last GPUs and last drivers don’t support 3D frame packing anymore.

* RTX40xx and RTX30xx don’t support it for sure
* RTX20xx might support it with old drivers or with more recent drivers patched with “3D Fix Manager” ([https://helixmod.blogspot.com/2017/05/3d-fix-manager.html](https://helixmod.blogspot.com/2017/05/3d-fix-manager.html))
* RTX10xx for sure support it with old drivers or with more recent drivers patched with “3D Fix Manager”
* 425.31 is the last official driver that supports 3D without the need to be patched up

I heard AMD GPUs still support 3D but I’m not exactly sure.

Intel GPUs (integrated or dedicated) might still support 3D to this day but I couldn’t find a lot of information on this and I couldn’t test for myself.

I have a Windows laptop Acer Nitro 5 with a dedicated RTX3060 and an integrated Intel GPU with the Intel CPU. So, I wanted to test with the Intel GPU. Unfortunately:

* The HDMI port is only hooked to the Nvidia dedicated GPU
* The USB-C port doesn’t support “video mode” so I couldn’t even use a USB-C to HDMI adapter
   * However, on most laptop, including some Acer Nitro 5 (but not mine…), the USB-C port supports a video output, and might be hooked to the integrated Intel GPU

##### 8. Other players and devices

Here are various notes about other players and devices. Before I ended up with the players mentioned above, I tested a shit ton of other players: PowerDVD 19 (last version to support 3D), DVDFab Player 6, Corel WinDVD, Plex, Infuse, Emby, Jellyfin, VLC and many others.

PowerDVD 19 is clearly the best “plug and play” player I have tested (DVDFab Player is really good too). It can play anything you throw at it. Unfortunately, even with a 1920x2205 resolution, it won’t activate 3D playback, because it won’t see an output device officially supporting a real 3D frame packing output. However, if your device still supports a real 3D frame packing output, you can enjoy PowerDVD 19.

I also have an Apple TV, and from what I heard, it doesn’t support 3D output.

I even tried a dedicated Blu-ray player with a USB port and it wasn’t able to play .mkv files, ISO files, H265 encoded .mp4 files and it didn’t know how to handle SBS files anyway so it was useless. Maybe some high-end Blu-ray players can handle all of this but certainly not entry level ones.

I heard that a RPi 3 can handle a real 3D frame packing output through HDMI with Kodi 18 (not sure for more recent versions of Kodi), which seems to be a nice setup but I don’t have a RPi to try. Maybe RPi 2 and RPi 4 can handle this as well but I’m not sure.

It seems that some android based players such as Vero ([https://osmc.tv/vero/](https://osmc.tv/vero/)) can handle 3D. Maybe the Nvidia Shield too but I’m not sure.

##### 9. Final words

I hope this guide will be helpful to some people. You can now enjoy your 3D movies

### SETUP GUIDE #2

From [thread:HDMI Frame-Packed 3D on a cheap Ryzen Mini PC in 2025](https://reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/1ia3nq8/hdmi_framepacked_3d_on_a_cheap_ryzen_mini_pc_in/)  
By: [/u/TartForward63](https://reddit.com/user/TartForward63)  

This is a loose guide for anyone still with a 3D TV or projector wondering how to play their full quality 3D Blu-ray rips using inexpensive modern hardware.  
The PC I used was a Beelink EQR6 with a Ryzen 5 6600H and 16 gigs of RAM.  

- First things first, you should downgrade from Windows 11 to 10. I simply did not have luck getting Windows to show 3D options under 11. 
After installing Windows 10 and installing AMD drivers (for me also [Beelink drivers](https://dr.bee-link.cn/)), check your Windows display settings and see if there's 
a 3D display mode slider in there (and enable it if you can). if it detects your hardware then you may proceed
- To play MVC encoded Blu-ray remuxes, I use a combo of MPC-BE and madVR.
- You are going to want to first get and use the stable madVR installer, then get and extract the test build and overwrite the files in the installation folder with those.
- After installation, open MPC-BE, go to **View > Options > Video** and set Video Renderer to **madVR**. Open **Properties > Edit Settings** to open madVR settings and 
go to **Rendering > Stereo 3D** and enable **stereo 3D Playback** as well as check **enable when playing 3D content**. In general settings enable **automatic fullscreen 
exclusive** mode. And under devices, in display modes for your device, enable **switch to matching display mode when playback starts** and **restore original display mode when media player is closed**. 
Under that in the text box to list all valid display modes, ensure 1080p23 and 1080p24 are listed.
- To play 3D files stored on a Plex server, you are going to want to install Kodi and the [PM4K addon](https://github.com/pannal/plex-for-kodi). Then locate playercorefactory.xml in the installation 
folder and edit it similar to [this](https://pastebin.com/pm17fYRm)
- You can also do this with PotPlayer using the EVR renderer (madVR and 3D don't seem to mix with it) to **play common codec (i.e. h264) SBS or OU style 3D files and 
output them as frame packed** I wasn't happy with PotPlayer's MVC decoding performance, at least not on AMD hardware without use of the Intel hardware decoding plugin. 
For these varied uses though I have multiple copies of Kodi installed in different locations. Ideally you should be able to add multiple external players to 
one installation and switch between them using "Play Using" in a Kodi context menu, however this is not accessible from the Plex interface. 
It seems quite feasible with [Composite](https://github.com/anxdpanic/plugin.video.composite_for_plex) or accessing your library via UPNP, maybe even Jellyfin, however I have not personally set up or tested those possibilities yet.

### Preparing 3D Content

By: [/u/xenago](https://reddit.com/user/xenago)  
1. Use MakeMKV to mux the video/audio/subtitle streams from discs into MKV files
2. If separate 2D files should be created, run through MakeMKV again without selecting the MVC video stream
3. If subtitles are required, use SubtitleEdit to ensure both a text-based format (SRT) and a Blu-ray image-based format (PGS/SUP) are available as some players are picky about formats
4. Use MKVToolNix to add/remove/modify the streams and produce final version(s)
5. Back up and place on network share for playback with any of the aforementioned software

<!-- Sub-section -->

### Notes

1. MakeMKV can remove the MVC data and produce a smaller-sized 2D AVC base version of films which are generally not viewed that way. 
An example of this would be Dune, the 3D version of which has different framing for shots and has less grain due to it bypassing the analog film print-scan step.

2. MKVToolNix can combine different audio/video/subtitle tracks into a single file. To use Dune as an example again, the 3D version does not include an Atmos 
audio track, but the 4K version does. By using MKVToolNix, it is possible to produce a hybrid file combining the 3D disc's video track with the 4K disc's 
audio track. This is also very helpful when multiple languages were released in different regions and not on the same disc.
